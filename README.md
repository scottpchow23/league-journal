# league journal

This project is meant to allow summoners to maintain a learning journal when playing league by allowing them to journal directly on games they play.

## goals

- Game level journals
  - Encourage summoners to comment on every game they play, providing inspiration with the following:
    - Can auto-detect role opponent
    - Can detect gold diff at 15
    - Can detect first death time
- Matchup level journals
  - By sorting journal entries by champion and role opponent champion, summoners can evaluate the matchup based on their experiences and the following metrics:
    - Average gold diff at 15
    - Which side dies first
    - Overall win-rate of the matchup
  - With this information, summoners can crystalize their understanding of the matchup into a self-created guide for the matchup.
    - Rune setups
    - First buy paths
    - Summoner spells
